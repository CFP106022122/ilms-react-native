# iLms react native app

This is a mobile version of [NTHU iLms](http://lms.nthu.edu.tw), an online course system for NTHU.

It's an UNOFFICIAL app, and I don't have any APIs to call from the site

All the data are parsed from the HTML tags.

[This](https://github.com/geniusgordon/ilms_app) is the old repo.

The new version is rewrote using *react-native*

Currently available at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geniusgordon.ilms)

*PRs are welcomed!*
